## What is an SSL_ERROR_RX_RECORD_TOO_LONG?
The Problem is unique to Firefox Users. 
Most of the Time it’s related to the improper Configuration of an SSL Certificate.
The Error Code: "SSL_ERROR_RX_RECORD_TOO_LONG" flashes up. 
This basically signals that the SSL Certificate isn’t properly configured.
As a Safeguard against Data Breaches and Cyber-Attacks, most Online Businesses of today don’t authorize a Connection unless there is a properly configured SSL Certificate. 
Usually, you need a Configuration that will enable it to use Port 443.
There could be other Reasons related to the Transport Layer Security (TLS). 
Whenever new Versions of TLS are released, some systems display this Problem. 
The current Version is TLS 1.3, and the most recent Problems started when it was first released. 
A similar Problem was experienced by many Users when TLS 1.2 was first released.

## How-To:

## 1. HTTP vs HTTPS:
HTTP works on the Application Layer and HTTPS works on the Transport Layer and is concerned with Port 443.

## 4. SSL Certificate:
The Problem may sometimes occur due to the improper Configuration of the SSL Certificate.
Even if you do manage a Connection, the Server won’t allow the Link if the SSL Certificate doesn’t meet the Standards.
In such a Case, you can either ensure proper Configuration of the SSL Certificate to meet all the Needs of the Server or get a new Certificate that does it.
